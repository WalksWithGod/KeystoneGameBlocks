                //      //       - So for now let's assume this approach, what about the moving door?
                //      //         Does it have it's own DomainObjectScript? Or does the parent frame
                //      //         Manage it?  What if the child moving door hasnt been loaded yet?
                //      //       - i htink clearly the animated door has to be a seperate entity
                //      //         afterall it can be animated/translated/rotated differently.
                //      //         I think one way around the issue of how does parent script know
                //      //         about the child (besides childIDs[] = EntityAPI.GetChildre(entityID);
                //      //         is to in fact script the door seperately.
                //      //         - and shouldnt the door itself be able to tell it's parent to
                //      //         enable/disable the CSGSource flag since if door is closed and undamaged
                //      //         it doesnt need CSG stencil operations applied.
                //      //         I think part of the answer is that when we design entities
                //      //         and their scripts, we are doing so with the knowledge that we know
                //      //         how they are constructed hierarchically and will exploit that in our scripts.
                //      //         For instance, the DoorEntity's script knows there's a child AnimatedDoor
                //      //         and that it's the first child.
                //      //         But the other thing from a DomainObjectScript point of view where i have custom
                //      //         fields like ArmorThickness, FrameStrength or whatever... is i dont want to have to
                //      //         do this twice for child doors.  I could circumvent this somewhat.. make the parent
                //      //         entity be the only interactable object and have it's picking / colliding be based on
                //      //         a box instead of geometry... but... it seems to get kludgy that way.
                //      //         but its definetly a headache to have the child door be defined (custom property wise)
                //      //         seperately.  It's as if in a sense, i dont want the child door to behave as it's own
                //      //         thing.  I dont want it scriptable at all... just the parent.
                //      //         And technically i could still allow the picker to have rules to query the child but
                //      //         to still report the picked entity as being the overall doorFrame entity.
                //      //         I think this is my answer.
                //      //         So we also need flags to ensure at runtime no other child can be added to 
                //      //         either doorframe or animated door.
                //      //         ***But what if the DoorFrame is added via XMLRead BEFORE
                //      //          the wall it wants to set the flag on?
                //      //         Recall that i wanted the DoorFrame to NOT be a child of Wall
                //      //         because i wanted the DoorFrame to be able to modify it's parent
                //      //         celledRegion's map layer. 
                //      //            - But what if the answer to this is to have the parent CelledRegion
                //      //              query the child for mods, rather than have the child mod the parent?
                //      //            This way the CelledRegion can handle modifying a flag to a wall
                //      //            and the map layer regardless of whether door or wall loads first?
