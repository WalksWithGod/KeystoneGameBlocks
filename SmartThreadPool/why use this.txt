
Prior to .net 3.5 this was a no brainer.  The previous thread pools were just poor performers and did not allow you to configure the number of threads in the pool.  3.5 has changed both of these issues.

However, you still cannot easily abort/cancel a threadpool work item using 3.5's threadpool.  You also can't configure the threadpool to use timeouts for help in determining when to abort a thread.
