    // Let's rethink this from ground up and consider a few factors
    // - Sims 3 
    // - FPSC  - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrEIQzUQ3DY
    // - Alien Shooter -> Love the details  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmhi_Vezdk0
    //   
    //  Rooms + Portals beats quadtree or octree
    //      - to enforce good design, you can only place interior components
    //        in "rooms" where a room is defined as a completely walled in interior.
    //  1) So a room is an array of tiles
    //    - in FPSC each tile is composed of several segments
    //      - 4 walls (each potentially divided into bottom/middle/top)
    //      - floor
    //      - ceiling
    //      - corners 
    //      - in FPSC Creator, a prefab segment behaves like a brush and dynamically determines
    //        what meshes are used for any adjacent tile based on whether corners are specified
    //        whether a CSG mesh is specified, etc.
    //      So i like this aspect of a "brush" to quickly flesh out rooms, but where FPSC stops
    //      short is in making all their parts composed of NON entities whereas I want fully destructable
    //      so everything will be an entity. 
    //      So portals + rooms is critical when indoors and NO SceneNode's per entity.  That would be insane
    //      for interior meshes.
    //      Our "rooms" or "volumes" or "spaces" whatever are our sceneNode's and are defined by our
    //      cells which can contain null space as well.
    //
    //  2) a ship is an array of rooms at various deck levels
    //  3) Unlike a region, a room does not have it's own coordinate system.
    //     It is like any other entity in the coordinate system of it's most immediate parent region
    //  
    //  Isometric view, we use fog of war 
    //  Isometric view we can also focus that fog around the player's captain avatar such that
    //  he can only see around him or via security cams if his character is in front of one.
    // 
    // Vehicle
    //      Mesh = ExteriorShip
    //      Region Interior - SceneNode connects not to Vehicle's, but to the Vehicle's SceneNode's parent SceneNode
    //             Volume[x,y,z] Volumes;  // each volume contains an array of cells
    //                                     // a cell contains AI hints mostly since otehrwise
    //                                     // the list of entities just need to be within the bounds
    //                                     // of the volume and can fall in dynamic vs static entities
    //                                     // Static entities can be destroyed potentially but otherwise
    //                                     // they aren't movable. 
    //                                     // So the cell info can tell us if an area is passable
    //                                     // if it has wiring, plumbing, venting, etc flags set
    //                                     // to determine flow of current, water, gas
    //             
    //
    //  as a user edits cells and errects walls or tears some down, we can easily
    // use floodfill to determine where new rooms are formed and where others are merged
    // 
    // So do we need to have cell level granularity for stacks of entities?
    // Maybe this is nothing we need to worry about for now.  WHat is i think decided
    // is that invidiual "Cells" are necessary because anytime you wish to edit a cell
    // you need to be able to know what that cell contains (via it's references) to know
    // how to delete it. 
    // Perhaps the compromise is that each "cell" does not use a scenenode because a Cell
    // is not an Entity.  It is more of an AI map.

    // -- HOWEVER- we can enforce a fog cone around the view so that the player as captain can only
    // see the area they are focussing on and this will preserve frame rate.

    // of the floor/ceiling/wall geometry for us by dynamically generating the correct meshes
