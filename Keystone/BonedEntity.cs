            //// normally though, we want Movement to NotifyChildModels, but since animation occurs afterwards, and since the bone matrices will change
            //// any child Model attached to a bone will not sync up unless we NotifyChildModels() here!
            //// But to avoid having two NotifyChildModels() for moving the character and then updating the animation, I think we could do something like
            //// Move (pos, scale, rotation, bUpdate) <-- where the animation is updated here too.
            //// But there's a problem.  If we want threaded updates, then Animation should be done INDEPENDANT of simulation thread.  
            //// Animations should interpolate and this would mean we _always_ notify childsModels here.
