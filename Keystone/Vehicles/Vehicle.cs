        //               see notes at Simulation.cs.UpdateForceProduction()
        //      - contacts in a way represents not necessarily visual items from cull pass
        //      they are game elements that are sent to the renderer for rendering.  This makes
        //      them part of a "Hud" and thus picking them reflects picking a visual representation
        //      back to the underlying "Contact" item.
        // Collections?  If you consider how these sensors and propulsion and such are
        // "ticked" during simulation, the collection isnt really required for that, however
        // when it comes to listing things, these collections are necessary but perhaps just
        // helper functions for that?
        // and then, we just need "Contacts" directly on Vehicle.
        // - Sensors.Contacts
        // - Propulsion.
        // - 
        // Can contacts be "scripted" somehow?  I mean i think we need to examine "contacts" front to back
        // - A "contact" list could be a property of "Vehicle" where the type is
        //   a collection of Contacts which are described in our common script
        // - Then a "contact" can easily be manipulated in the Vehicle script.  The "Vehicle" script
        //   however would need a way to process this incoming message from the server that a contact
        //   would found.  This is similar to how we use propulsion as Product/Consumer
        //      1) Enemy and Friendly and unknown vehicles emit an "emission" product of some kind.
        //      1b) Filter of the emission occurs server side from script so that only 
        //         consumers that should "detect" a contact will consume that emission.
        //      1c) Then skill test of sensors/sensor operator needs to be done.
        //      1d) so scripting of this filer in user_functions.css is what we need to do.
        //      2) player vehicle receives the emission and consumes it.   
        //         - consuming means adding to Vehicle.Contact list.  Or updating that Contact list
        //         wth the current information about that contact and also registering with Hud and such.
        //         I'm not sure how registering with Hud.cs occurs though.  I think our Hud.cs should be
        //         written in client.exe and be written knowing that a Vehicle contains .Contacts and that
        //         when in Navigation mode, there is a Vehicle that is the players that is assumed to be
        //         active and focus of that Navigation.  
        //         - but wait, surely that must be done server side because if a client is given this information
        //         there is no way to ensure that the client will properly ignore those
        //         emissions that fail the detection test.
        //       2b) Consumption of the emission by a sensor should then update any contact list and
        //           register for rendering somehow. I think the contact list if it's a scripted object
        //           perhaps managed by the Vehicle script actually (contact list is a custom property)
        //           must register for the contact to be rendered on a hud.  I think that must involve
        //           the Hud.cs just knowing that there is a "contacts" custom property in Vehicle 
        //           
        //      3) This makes me wonder if instead, a "sense" product is emitted, and consumed
        //          by a client, that may or may not emit a "detection" result.
        //        
        //      
        // RE: Contacts, see notes at Simulation.cs.UpdateForceProduction()
        //          - a sensor contact that is a ship that was added to the scene because initially
        //            detected, could track it's lastDetection time and thus when it becomes too stale
        //            can be removed.  So in this case, that it's in the scenegraph is ok because it's a
        //            proxy and may not contain full details AND because it's current position is subject
        //            to update info by server.
        //           - normally a contact discovery would be done independant of graphics culling.
        //            but once discovered, its added to scene and the Vehicle.Sensors.Contacts
        //            will then manage when those contacts are stale and removed.  
        //           - contacts i think will then need to be resolved soon...
        //            Assuming the simulation will notify the client of contact update info, users
        //            can add some preliminary info about that contact to the db.  But it will be
        //            varying degrees of accurate.
        //              - but some contacts i think we may know its a ship, but not which one
        //                so adding to main db is not correct.  instead we'd want more of a tempary
        //                contacts db.  In fact, i think our "dynamic" db is now appearing to be 
        //                a very seperate thing.  for dynamics we can have historical plot info
        //                like stocks, and current dbs for contacts made within last x interval.
        //            - this way also full vehicles of other players will also exist outside the main db
        //              sending over the zipped xmldb of a single vehicle should be pretty tiny if there
        //              are no mesh/geometry/textures and just xml.
