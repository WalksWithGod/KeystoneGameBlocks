        // and now need for this child to be represented in the scene.  NOTE: we have a 1:1 relationship with a parent region and it's spatial
        // regionNode representation.  That is why we can recurse backward through the parent Entities 
        // ack - but consider a moon orbiting a planet?  
        // ack2 - what about things being carried by a player that end up straddling a portal?
        // ack3 - what about a tank barrel that is part of an overall tank, and so doesnt have a fixed bound "region" because when the turret 
        //       swivels that bounds changes.  This is part of why the spatial graph is / should be independant of the parentEntity childEntity relationship.
        //       right?  But the tank turret and tracks and body are 3 sub-entities of a "tank" entity that itself has no bounds.  And those three parts
        //       are siblings and child of that entity container object.  Spatially an overall regionNode could be created to represent the overall
        //       entity and it will have 3 entitynode's underneath it.
        // answer?  I think maybe the answer is based on which "region" something is in.  An entity attached as a child (e.g. sword in player's hand)
        //          is ultimately recursed upward til we find the region it's in.  Then in the spatailgraph it's added as a child to the RegionNode
        //          that hosts that Region.  However while recursing backwards, we accumulate the matrices of every parent along the way.
