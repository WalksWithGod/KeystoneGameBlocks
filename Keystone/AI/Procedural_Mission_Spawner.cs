        //  - The paper describes Game Forge, a system that can be given a narrative structure
        //    and will design an RPG world to suit it - even taking into account what kind of gameplay 
        //    the player is after. It has some interesting ideas about how to generate worlds that suit stories, 
        //    and the adaptive nature of the tool is something that developers of all genres, from roguelikes to 
        //    casual games, will be interested in.


        // Procedural Name Generation
        // TODO: A procedural name generation program that creates names (and titles)
        //       by first generating a list of names for various things, and then
        //       creating names of heros and names for occupations and then
        //       "inventing" or perhaps just picking a style that is constructed from
        //       sub-styles, and then generating names that way.
        //       - this way history and mythos can be tied into names as well.
        //      My point is, that we can make smarter tools for things like name generation
        //      as well.  And we can potentially do it in a procedural way so that
        //      names dont need to be stored.
        //
