some highlights

"In my port, "SlowPerlin" is libnoise's implementation, and already has the fast, standard, and best settings, which as you said, use linear, cubic, and quintic interpolation.

What I refered to as "FastPerlin" is the alternative class I wrote that uses Ysaneya's fast noise optimization. Since you suggest this is not Perlin, I was asking if you could suggest an alternative name.

In my port I actually renamed the quality settings to "Low", "Standard" and "High" to avoid confusing them with the "SlowPerlin" and "FastPerlin" distinction."
