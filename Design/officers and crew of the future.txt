gosford park dinner scene
das boot officer's mess scenes


I want part of the atmosphere of the crew to be very professional but beyond that, i want every person to have a sort of dignity and discipline that comes from being true rennassance gentlemen and women...

i want for them to show users what people could be like... what we should be like in the future

for officers,  i want this to contrast with the type of crew in certain non military, non corporate, privateer outfits.  Mercanary bounty hunter outfits might be very rough and crude indeed.

i want the main game to be a way for player to just explore various careers and lifestyles in this simulation and from there have a very rouglike permadeth situation.
