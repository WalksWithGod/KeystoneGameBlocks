 love Bear McCreary's "Elegy" from Battlestar Galactica season 4 soundtrack for a background music to our sim when it's on a long journey to a new system....  the song really seems to fit the visuals of a lone ship against a backdrop of stars on a sort of fragile journey through the harshness and loneliness of space.
