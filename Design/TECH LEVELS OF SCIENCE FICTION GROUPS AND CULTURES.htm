<p>A quick cheat sheet for Tech Levels:

<p>Tech Level 10:       Modern Day Technology<br>
Tech Levels 11 - 15: Hard Science Fiction/Near Future Tech<br>
Tech Levels 16 - 20: Sci-Fi/Space Opera Tech<br>
Tech Levels 21 - 25: Ultra Tech<br>
Tech Levels 25+:          god-like Tech<br></p>


<hr>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" color="turquoise">

<P>This is a purely for-fun article to see where on the Tech Level scale different civilizations and organizations from various sci-fi sources fit.  This is 100% purely subjective on the part of the author, and will no doubt be disputed (and probably rightly so) by others with different takes on the subject.</P>

<P>These assessments reflect tech commonly available to the group/society, and do not take into account exotic research or superscience prototypes that occasionally pop up in these sources.  Also, some technologies that depend more on the workings of the universe turning out a certain way (such as FTL drives, time travel, psionics, and force fields, among others) than on raw technical sophistication were not used in this evaluation unless the technology was uniquely signature to that culture or unusually potent in some way.</P>

<P>Also, some SF sources were left out because the author has not seen enough of them to make an accurate judgment about the societies portrayed in them.  These include some fan favorites such as <U>Battlestar Galactica</U>, <U>Farscape</U>, and others. Others I may have just plum forgotten about. Apologies all around.</P>

Tech Level: 10-13

<p>Perhaps the most incompetent invaders in modern science fiction (they achieved a mere draw against WWII-Era Earth,) the fanatically conservative Race seemed to have technology pretty much on par with modern-day, early 21st Century Earth, with the exception of interstellar flight and suspended animation.</p>

<hr>
<b><u>James Bond</u></b><br>
Tech Level: 11

<p>The spy agencies and the supervillains they often faced off against always seemed to employ technology just slightly beyond the current cutting edge of the time any particular movie was made, placing them perpetually at Level 11.</p>

<b><u>War of the Worlds</u> (The Martians/Novel)</b><br>
Tech Level: 14

<p>With sophisticated walking war machines, heat beams, and massive launch guns, the original version of the Martians seem to fit fairly comfortably at Level 14, though some sectors of their technology (such as aviation and microbiology)seemed to lag considerably.</p>

<B><u>Space: 1999</u> (Moonbase Alpha)<br>
</B>
Tech Level: 14

<P>Though set in the mind-boggling distant year of 1999, the design and tech of the lost moonbase seem at least a good fifty or more years ahead of what’s available today, with compact laser weapons, versatile interplanetary spacecraft, and advanced and long-enduring space habitat systems.</P>

<b><u>BattleTech</u></b><br>

<hr>
<b><u>War Of The Worlds</u></b> (The Martians/Movie 2005)<br>

<p>Very few aspects of this version made much sense, plot wise or technologically.  Still, advanced robotic systems, “heat” beams, and some odd form of teleportation places them at about Level 16.</p>

Tech Level: 16-17

<P>Both human and Kzin civilizations are modest sub-light interstellar societies as the Wars begin.  Despite using every dirty technolgical trick of warfare available to them before and after obtaining the hyperdrive, their overall level of tech doesn’t advance very far throughout the two-century era (following first contact) in which most of the novels take place.</P>

<p>The star system the series takes place in was settled by a joint American/Chinese alliance, after abandoning an overpopulated Earth.

<B><u>Foundation</u><br>
</B>
Tech Level: 17-18

<P>Asimov’s greatest work focused on the fall of an ancient galaxy-wide empire and a radical mathematician’s vision for saving humanity.  Both the Galactic Empire (Level 17) and the Foundation (Level 18 by the end of the series) are the archetypal space opera civilizations.  Though written originally in the 1940s, it was updated a number of times by its author, and includes advanced AI robots, cybernetics, terraforming, and world-cities.</P>

<P>The Gua’uld have been established as technological scavengers; they rarely come up with concepts and technologies on their own, but instead steal them from other races.  Even so, they established a stable (if oppressive) society at about Level 18 that lasted for many thousands of years.</P>

<P>Tech Level: 18</P>

<b><u>War of the Worlds</u></b> (The Martians/Movie 1953)<br>

<p>The Martians of the 1953 film version were considerably more sophisticated and inimical than their Victorian-Era or Spielberg-spawned cousins, with heat beams, disintegrators, anti-gravity, and nigh-impenetrable force fields.  Like the versions in the original novel, however, certain sections of the technology (such as aviation and microbiology) were woefully lagging.</p>

<b><u>Independence Day</u></b> (Invaders)<br>

Tech Level: 18

<p>These would-be exterminators of humanity created a megastructure interstellar generation ship and had technologies such as sophisticated anti-gravity, bio-mechanical armors, plasma weapons, and nigh-impenetrable force fields.  Their computer systems, however, seemed to lag considerably behind this, at Level 10.</p>

<P>After several centuries of peaceful trading for higher technologies from both the Puppeteers and Outsiders, the races of Known Space made great leaps in their understanding of the universe.  Advanced fusion drives, reactionless thrusters, teleportation, disintegrator weapons, monomolecular wire, and more are at their disposal when Louis Wu and his companions set out to explore the Ringworld.</P>

The Technocore manipulated the World Web with &quot;gifts&quot; such as the Farcaster system that humanity had no hope of understanding at the time.  Even so, on its own, humanity was able to create a sophisticated civilization that employed livings starships, organic dyson spheres, terraforming, world-cities, and gravity-defying carpets.</P></font></td>

<b><u>Andromeda</u></b><br>
Tech Level: 21

<p>With megastructures, terraforming, AIs, advanced robotics, advanced bioengineering, star-destroying nova bombs, and singularity cannons, the universe of Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda seems to hover around Level 21.

Capable of harnessing zero-point energy, intergalactic travel, and wholesale manipulation of space/time, their most significant contribution was the creation and establishment of the Stargate networks in both the Pegasus and Milky Way galaxies.

<P>The Technocore is a group of highly sophisticated but disembodied AIs that have a manipulative, parasitic relationship with humanity throughout the Hyperion novels.  The Core created the stargate-like Farcaster network, was able to mimic the Shrike’s anti-entropic time manipulation, manufactured the brain-frying Deathwands, and created symbiotic cruciforms that could regenerate a human fully from any injury.</P>
