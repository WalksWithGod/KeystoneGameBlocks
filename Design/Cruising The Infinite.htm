<P>Exploring the universe is one of the human race's great dreams. All but a few 
believe it is not inevitable that our descendants will someday emerge from our 
planetary cradle and spread out among the stars.</P>
<P>But the spaces between solar systems are unimaginably vast. The fastest 
object ever launched, the Voyager 2 probe, is traveling at dozens of miles per 
second, and yet it would not reach even the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in 
less than 100,000 years--twenty times longer than the age of the civilization 
that built it.</P>
<P>In many science fiction sources, alien star systems are traversed by ships 
with magical hyperdrives that can make the trip in a relative blink of an 
eye--days or weeks instead of centuries and millennia. But the reality of how 
humanity will explore our interstellar neighborhood is shaping up to be of a far 
different character. Voyages will take many decades, and the greatest hurdle we 
will face will not be screaming starfighters or glowing space anomalies, but 
endless, endless tracts of utter emptiness.</P>
<P>We are poised to begin this incredible adventure perhaps within the next one 
hundred years, as space technology begins catching up with our interstellar 
dreams. Robot probes will inevitably be our scouts, going before us to tell us 
what's waiting for us in the great dark. But when human beings are ready to go, 
how will we get there?</P>
<P>This article is designed to answer that question, looking at cutting-edge 
theories and technology that can give us realistic options for human 
interstellar exploration.</P>
<HR>

<P><B><FONT size=4>STEPPING STONES</FONT></B></P>
<P>In most scenarios of interstellar exploration, immense ships of one design or 
another leave one life-bearing world in the inner system of a star, fly through 
the void, then brake around another life-bearing world in the inner system of 
another star. The old assumption was that the outer reaches of a star system, 
being cold, lifeless, and only sparsely populated with material resources, 
wasn't worth the bother.</P>
<P>However, discoveries in the past decade has shown that the borderlands of a 
star system may reach much farther, and contain much more in it, than previously 
thought. Frozen worlds and objects that can be used as way-stations and 
resources for journeys out into the void.</P>
<P>Stepping Stone strategy is mentioned in a number of science fiction sources, 
such as the novels _Heart of the Comet_ by David Brin and Gregory Benford, _The 
Gripping Hand_ by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, and _Permanence_ by Karl 
Schroeder, but to the best of my knowledge no one has yet done a serious 
technical study of it.</P>
<P>For our first stop beyond Pluto, there's the Kuiper Belt, which extends from 
the orbit of Neptune to at least 50 AUs (about 7 billion kilometers) out from 
the sun in more or less the same orbital plane as the planets. It is estimated 
that at least 70,000 cometary objects with diameters larger than 100 kilometers 
exist in this Belt, all primordial remnants from the accretion disk that 
originally formed the solar system. Pluto, its moon Charon, the 
recently-discovered worldlet Quaoar, and a large object near Saturn's orbit 
called Chiron are all thought to be large Kuiper Belt objects.</P>
<P>There's also the Oort Cloud, an even larger and more widely dispersed 
collection of cometary objects that forms a rough sphere around the solar 
system, starting from about where the Kuiper Belt ends. Comprised of an 
estimated one trillion significantly sized objects, the Oort Cloud is thought to 
extend to at least 50,000 AUs from the sun, though some estimates put the outer 
boundary at 2 light years or more. The total mass of all the comets in the cloud 
are thought to exceed 40 times the mass of Earth, though individual objects may 
be tens of millions of kilometers apart.</P>
<P>Rogue planets, worlds either ejected from their home star systems or ones 
that formed alongside stars in interstellar nurseries but were never bound to 
them, are now thought to be far more numerous than previously thought. As are 
Brown Dwarves, objects too big to be a planet but too small to ignite into a 
star, which have masses between 15 and 80 times that of Jupiter. Both types of 
objects combined are now considered to be more numerous than mainstream stars, 
and litter the vast interstellar depths.</P>
<P>The Sun itself is thought by some astronomers to have a distant 
near-interstellar companion that may either be a rogue planet or a brown dwarf. 
Named Nemesis, it is theorized to have an orbital period measured in millions of 
years, periodically sweeping through the Oort Cloud to send comets raining into 
the inner system, causing mass extinctions such as the one that wiped out the 
dinosaurs.</P>
<P>The Stepping Stone strategy for exploration takes advantage of all these 
various objects to very slowly build a 'step ladder' out of one solar system and 
into another. Using both passive astronomical techniques and powerful active 
radar arrays, most of the major objects in the Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud, and 
nearby interstellar space can be found and their orbits plotted. One first 
builds bases and/or colonies on the outer planets to use for building and 
refueling outbound ships. Then one moves into the Kuiper Belt, mining the 
objects there for fuel and hollowing out larger comets to use for bases and 
colonies. One repeats the process once again for the Oort Cloud, then again for 
any significant objects that may exist in interstellar space.</P>
<P>Once a human presence is established on an interstellar brown dwarf or rogue 
planet or lonely comet, the process is reversed in a nearby system, moving 
inward from the interstellar way station to the new system's Oort Cloud, then to 
its Kuiper Belt, to its outer planets, and finally to its inner system. If a 
conveniently-placed interstellar object is absent, a comet or a group thereof 
can be towed or boosted into place.</P>
<P>Needless to say, this may be an extremely gradual, multi-generational 
process. In fact, some think it may not even be done intentionally. As humanity 
moves out into the solar system, the inner worlds may fill up within a 
millennium, forcing some elements of its population ever outward looking for new 
resources and living space.</P>

<P>So we have a potential path to the stars. Now how exactly do we use it?</P>
<P>There are four basic drive technologies with the power and fuel efficiency 
for possible interstellar flight now being studied. These are:</P>
<P>--Nuclear Pulse Drives, which use rapid detonations of nuclear bombs to drive 
a ship forward.</P>
<P>--Nuclear Rockets, which use either fission or fusion techniques to superheat 
exhaust plasmas.</P>
<P>--Solar Sails, which use enormous but gossamer-thin sails to harness sunlight 
and directed laser light for propulsion.</P>
<P>--Antimatter Rockets, which harness the enormous energies released from 
matter/antimatter annihilations.</P>
<P>All have been extensively detailed in articles for Orbital Vector, the links 
for which can be found at the bootom of the page. Though primarily envisioned 
for near-future planetary exploration, each is capable of reaching nearby 
Stepping Stone objects or even direct flight to nearby stars within only a few 
decades of travel time.</P>
<P>A fifth major type of drive has also been proposed, meant almost exclusively 
for interstellar missions: the Bussard ramjet. </P>
<HR>

    </TD>
    <TD><FONT color=lime size=2>Conceptual image courtesy NASA 
  </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>This drive was first conceived by Robert Bussard in 1960, and has since been 
used in countless science fiction stories and novels, such as _Tau Zero_ by Poul 
Anderson, _A Deepness in the Sky_ by Vernor Vinge, and numerous "Known Space" 
stories by Larry Niven.</P>
<P>The Bussard Ramjet concept relies on the fact that the vacuum of space is not 
_quite_ as empty as we think. While matter is spread incredibly thin in the 
depths between the stars, there still exists about one hydrogen atom per cubic 
centimeter (compared to the 10^18 atoms per cubic centimeter in Earth's 
atmosphere at sea level.) The Bussard Ramjet uses an immense forward-facing 
conical magnetic field to scoop up this interstellar medium as it zooms through 
space, using its tremendous forward velocity to force the funneled hydrogen 
molecules to a fusion state at the apex of the converging magnetic fields. The 
super-hot fusion plasma is then expelled for thrust.</P>
<P>Used in this way, a Ramjet-equipped ship would never run out of fuel as long 
as it maintained a certain minimum velocity for the system to remain 
functioning. This exact minimum velocity is a subject for debate; some sources 
say one percent lightspeed or so, while others quote it as high as six percent. 
Whatever it may be, the ship would need a secondary drive system that would 
allow it to not only get up to these velocities without using the ramscoop but 
to maneuver around within a star system where significant fractions of 
lightspeed may prove undesirable. Typical secondary drive sources include light 
sails, fusion drives, and antimatter rockets.</P>
<P>Because it has a practically unlimited fuel supply, a Bussard ramjet is a 
particularly powerful stardrive. It can theoretically accelerate for any 
arbitrary interval of time, whether it be a few minute or many millennia. Very 
efficient ramjet drives could come to within a hairbreadth's of the velocity of 
light, though some source say that a ramjet's more practical limit may be 
between 50% and 85% lightspeed. Accelerating at a constant 1 g, a Bussard Ramjet 
could get to within a few percentage points of lightspeed within a year.</P>
<P>A wide-beam laser is shot ahead of the vehicle, imparting enough energy to 
any hydrogen atom in its path to force its electrons to fly off. The magnetic 
field projected by the ship attracts the positively charged ions and repels the 
now free electrons. The tremendous forward velocity of the ship and the tapering 
cone of the magnetic fields force the protons together with enough force to 
spark a fusion reaction. Alternately, the compressed hydrogen can be catalyzed 
by an on-board antimatter supply to produce more efficient fusion reactions.</P>
<P>One of the main difficulties in building a Bussard ramjet (aside from getting 
it up to the minimal operational velocity of one to six percent lightspeed) is 
creating magnetic fields large enough to gather enough fuel to be strong enough 
to handle the stresses of scooping and fusing hydrogen at significant fractions 
of lightspeed. In order to obtain enough fuel for continual operation, the scoop 
would have to be thousands of miles wide and relatively narrow to aid in 
maintaining magnetic field strength. The strength of the field would also be 
immense, on the order of ten million tesla, making them instantly deadly to any 
living creature nearby.</P>
<P>Some concern has been expressed about the amount of drag the interstellar 
medium will induce on a ramjet. Moving at significant fractions of lightspeed, 
the repeated impacts of the interstellar hydrogen on the immense ramscoop field 
is thought by some to offset much of the acceleration produced by the fusion 
engines, greatly reducing the starship's capabilities. If this is so, a ramjet's 
top speed may be only 15% to 25% lightspeed. However, it has also been pointed 
out that the impacts would not necessarily produce nothing but waste energy, as 
the ramscoop uses the impacts as part of its scooping and fusion processes, so 
how much drag a bussard ramjet would actually experience is up for debate.</P>
<P>With Stepping Stone objects, we have a sparse but traversible road to the 
stars. With various drive technologies, we have the means to get there. Now all 
we have to do is figure out how to get very fragile biological crew through the 
decades of travel to reach destinations light-years distant.</P>
<HR>

<P><B><FONT size=4>GENERATION SHIPS</FONT></B></P>
<P>Generation ships are also called space arks or world ships.</P>
<P>The idea of a generation ship has been around since the golden age of science 
fiction, and has seen many an incarnation down through the decades. Two of the 
most famous examples are the short story, "Orphans of the Sky" by Robert 
Heinlein and the original Star Trek episode, "For the World is Hollow and I Have 
Touched the Sky." A generation ship that used time dilation to reduce a five 
million year journey into a mere subjective one thousand years was seen in the 
novel _Ring_ by Stephen Baxter. The very first Science Fiction RPG, 
"Metamorphosis Alpha," was also set aboard a gigantic space ark.</P>
<P>A generation ship is the most straightforward means of dealing with 
century-long journeys from one star system to the next. The ship is a miniature, 
self-sustaining world in and of itself, much like an O'Neil colony, and the crew 
of the ship will live out their natural lifetimes on board, working, playing, 
building, breeding, etc. Their children and grandchildren and so on will be 
brought up on board ship as it coasts between the stars, and become the 
operating crew in their turn.</P>
<P>Extremely efficient resource management would be absolutely essential to the 
success of a generation ship. Recycling systems would have to work at nearly one 
hundred percent to ensure that the ship and its human population will survive 
the many decades needed to reach its destination. The generation ship could also 
pick up additional resources via Stepping Stone objects that may be along its 
way with subcraft, or the world where the ship was launched may have sent 
unmanned resupply ships ahead of the main spacecraft. The ship would have to 
rendezvous with these resupply craft en route in the depths of interstellar 
space.</P>
<P>One of the perils of generation ships that has served as the gristle for a 
great many science fiction stories is that human societies are dynamic, not 
static, and the culture on board a generation ship is bound to change in the 
decades or centuries the vessel will be en route. Sometimes, in these stories, 
the society which starts the voyage will be torn down in a revolution and 
something wholly other has taken its place by the time the ship reaches its 
destination. Democratic societies are replaced by ruthless dictatorships, or 
carefully engineered social structures are ripped apart by unacceptable thoughts 
and ideas. Or, in the most cliched type of societal breakdown, the population 
somehow loses its high-tech knowledge and forgets that it is on a vehicle. It 
comes to view the ship as the entire universe as generations go by.</P>
<P>These dire scenarios may not seem very likely, but they do underscore the 
necessity of taking into account the inevitable changing tides in a human 
society over the long period of time the ship will be en route. One way of 
dealing with this may be to start the ship with only a small seed population 
confined to one small area of the space ark's artificial habitat, which will 
then grow and "settle" the rest of the ship's living space in the ensuing the 
decades or centuries. This way, all the extra space can serve as a "safety 
valve" for relieving societal stress by giving disgruntled sections of the 
culture places they can claim as their own. This can only work as long as there 
is fallow habitat to settle, but if planned properly the ship should reach its 
destination long before the population runs out of new living space.</P>
<P>Experts disagree on the exact minimum crew needed at the start of a voyage. 
The fewer inhabitants in the beginning, the fewer resources they will consume 
and the slower the population will grow throughout the voyage. However, if you 
have too few people, the crew risks inbreeding problems that are sure to arise 
in succeeding generations. Numbers as large as 10,000 and as small as 25 have 
all been proposed depending on different sociological and biological 
assumptions. However, a compromise range of several hundred to a thousand or so 
initial population would probably be a good median strategy.</P>
<P>The most common vision for generation ship design is to model it after an 
O'Neil colony, first proposed by Gerard O'Neil in the 1970s. This is basically a 
gigantic rotating cylinder or disk with an interstellar propulsion system 
attached. The cylinder may be from several hundred meters to several hundred 
kilometers in diameter, and rotated on its long axis to provide artificial 
gravity along its inner curved surface. The interior is sculpted and pressurized 
to provide an Earth-like environment, complete with forests, hills, streams, 
lakes, and so on. The inner environment is usually envisioned as being large 
enough to generate its own weather, supplemented and/or controlled by the ship's 
systems. On an orbiting O'Neil colony, light is provided by gimbaled mirrors and 
enormous transparent sections of the hull. On an interstellar generation ship, 
illumination would have to be provided by large strips or nodes of lighting 
equipment recessed into the inner surface.</P>
<P>An O'Neil style generation ship could ultimately hold from 10,000 to several 
hundred thousand inhabitants, depending on its exact size and design.</P>

<P>A hollowed asteroid generation ship basically converts an entire asteroid a 
kilometer or more in size into an interstellar craft. The center is hollowed out 
into either a spherical or cylindrical chamber, and the asteroid itself is set 
spinning to provide artificial gravity along its inner surface. Usually the 
inner habitat takes up only a small fraction of the overall volume of the 
asteroid.</P>
<P>The hollowed asteroid scheme has two advantages over the O'Neil style space 
arks. First and foremost, the inner habitat is protected by a thick shell of 
rock that, depending on the original size of the asteroid, could be many 
kilometers thick. If the ship is expected to pass through hazardous 
conditions--such as areas of possible meteoroid impact or high radiation--such 
armor could prove fortuitous. Second, the rock shell can provide megatons of 
additional mineral resources the crew can mine during the long voyage, readily 
adding to whatever stores they may have packed along at the beginning.</P>
<P>A variation on the hollowed asteroid is the hollowed comet. This functions 
very similarly to an asteroid space ark, except that the outer shell would be 
comprised of water and methane ice. This could prove advantageous as the crew 
will have a readily available source of gigatons of water and hydrogen to use 
for consumables. A variation of the hollowed-comet ship was contemplated in the 
novel _Heart of the Comet_ by David Brin and Gregory Benford.</P>

<P>Sleeper ships have been seen or mentioned in many science fiction sources, 
including the original Star Trek episode "Space Seed," the original Planet of 
the Apes movie, the early 90's TV series _Earth 2_, and in "Known Space" stories 
by Larry Niven.</P>
<P>Basically, the crew of the ship spends most of the many decades in transit in 
suspended animation, where they age very slowly or not at all. Their physical 
condition is monitored by computer and they will eventually be awakened by 
automated ship's systems. Many methods for suspended animation have been 
proposed, including cryonics, chemically induced hibernation, fluid replacement, 
cryogenic suspension, nanotech restructuring, or combinations thereof. The 
length of a voyage may not be limited by the technology of the stardrive but by 
how long the human crew can safely remain in suspended animation without risking 
permanent medical complications.</P>
<P>Depending on circumstances, it may not be wise to have the entire crew in 
suspended animation for the entire voyage. Individual crewmembers may have to be 
awakened for rotating 'watches' while the rest of the crew sleeps so they can 
monitor systems and do routine maintenance. For example, on a ten year voyage 
with a crew of twenty, two crewmembers at a time would spend a year awake to 
tend to the ship. On very long voyages of centuries or more, the ship would have 
to run on automatic for most of the time, with the crew being only occasionally 
awakened for brief periods for routine maintenance or for emergencies. </P>
<HR>

<P><B><FONT size=4>COLONIZING SEED SHIPS</FONT></B></P>
<P>Seed ships are an intriguing idea for colonizing interstellar space that 
depends heavily on extremely advanced and reliable artificial intelligence and 
robotics. It occasionally pops up in various science fiction sources. The novel 
_The Songs of Distant Earth_ by Arthur C. Clarke, the animated movie _Titan 
A.E._, and the "Scorched Earth" episode of the TV series _Stargate: SG-1_, all 
used seed ships as major plot points.</P>
<P>No known technique can yet freeze a human being and bring him back to life. 
However, it is now a tried and true technology to freeze human zygotes 
(fertilized ova) for long periods of time, then thaw them and bring them to full 
term. Since it is assumed no human could survive the centuries-long trips 
between the stars, seed ships are fully automated. When they reach their 
destination after many decades in transit, the ship lands, and the vessel's 
mainframe oversees the thawing and bringing to term human zygotes via artificial 
wombs. When the ship-born children come to term, robots take over rearing them, 
educating and training them to become the seed population of a new human 
colony.</P>
<P>Usually this first round of humans, from a handful to several dozen in 
number, is then used to awaken and raise several hundred more humans from the 
ship's biological stores. These then form the first human community on planet, 
which expands in the usual manner in succeeding generations.</P>
<P>Actually, the most difficult part of creating a seed ship mission wouldn't be 
the stardrive or plotting an interstellar trajectory or anything so mundane, but 
in creating artificial intelligences and robots that could handle and raise 
human children without causing any undue psychological or physiological damage 
to their charges. The mission designers would no doubt try to make the parental 
computers as human-like as possible, with true androids being used by advanced 
enough societies.</P>
<P>An alternative to child-rearing robots would be to keep the children in a 
total virtual reality environment from birth to maturity, as per the movie The 
Matrix, with tissue growth, bone density, and muscle tone maintained through 
electrodynamic stimulation or nanotech restructuring. Within the VR environment, 
they experience a perfectly normal childhood, then are given "transitional" 
scenarios that allow them to psychologically ease into their waking lives on an 
alien planet.</P>
<P>If technology such as memory printing is available, it could also be possible 
to clone and quick-grow individuals as a seed population, then imprint them with 
the memories and skills of specialists recorded back on the homeworld.</P>
<P>Besides human zygotes, the ship could also carry frozen genetic material of 
livestock, crops, and other useful lifeforms.</P>
<HR>

<P><B><FONT size=4>TERRAFORMING SEED SHIPS</FONT></B></P>
<P>Both _Titan A.E._ and the "Scorched Earth" episode of _Stargate: SG-1_ used 
this type of craft.</P>
<P>The Colonizing Seed Ship assumes that the ship will be sent to a previously 
known planet where the conditions to support its colonists already exist. 
However, the Terraforming Seed Ship is created with the ability to transform a 
planet (or, in Titan A.E.'s case, a loose planet-sized mass of ice asteroids) to 
fit the requirements of its colonists. By necessity, it needs to be much bigger, 
more powerful, and more advanced that its Colonizing cousin.</P>
<P>Besides the zygotes of the colonists, the seed ship would also need to carry 
the genetic material of all the plants, animals, and microorganisms that will 
form the ecology of the terraformed planet. It would also have to be smart 
enough to set up that delicately-balanced ecology while avoiding the many 
pitfalls that can plague such an undertaking.</P>
<P>Terraforming an entire planet can prove be a long, arduous, and 
resource-consuming process, one that could take many centuries. A terraforming 
seed ship, therefore, would have to be built as tough and as long-enduring as 
the most rugged generation ship, as it may be a very, very long time running on 
automatic, between its decades-long journey and centuries or more terraforming a 
planet or planet-sized mass.</P>
<P>Once a habitable environment is established, the ship gestates its human crew 
and raises them as per a colonizing seed ship, above.</P>
<HR>

<P><B><FONT size=4>INTERSTELLAR CYCLERS</FONT></B></P>
<P>The Interstellar Cycler concept was envisioned by science fiction author Karl 
Schroeder in his novel _Permanence_.</P>
<P>No matter what technique you use, it takes an enormous amount of energy to 
accelerate a craft up to near-light speed. So much so, in fact, that it may not 
be worth an equal amount of energy to simply decelerate it again at its 
destination. The interstellar Cycler envisions a vessel that never slow down, 
but uses various techniques to affect turns around a local neighborhood of 
stellar objects to inscribe a rough circle. A cycler may visit anywhere from a 
handful to many dozens of star systems and Stepping Stone objects before 
returning to its point of origin and completing a circle.</P>
<P>The inhabited systems it passes accelerates smaller cargo vessels to catch up 
to it and decelerate cargoes the cycler drops off. This way, no one world or 
outpost has to foot the entire cost of building and launching the interstellar 
vessel; they only have to absorb the cost of accelerating and decelerating much 
smaller cargo vessels. The cycler also takes some of the cargo to slowly build 
itself up. In the history of Schroeder's novel, the original cycler started out 
as an unmanned magnetic sail probe; after many centuries, it grew into a 
full-scale, fully-inhabited fleet of city-sized structures.</P>
<P>To begin the process, a magnetic sail is accelerated by an array of powerful 
particle beams out of its home solar system. It then deploys large loops of 
highly charged superconductive wires. These interact with the interstellar 
medium and galactic magnetic fields, using the Lorentz Force (the force exerted 
on charged particles in a fixed magnetic field) to very gradually turn the 
vessel. This is combined with other techniques, such as long-range assists from 
the home system's particle beams, gravity slingshots, and on-board reactive 
engines such as ion drives, to slowly turn the vessel and align it with its next 
destination. After it reaches one to six percent lightspeed, it could perhaps 
even use magnetic field scoops to gather hydrogen from the interstellar medium 
to power a Bussard ramjet system.</P>
<P>Its a matter of some debate whether affecting large, gradual turns at 
significant fractions of lightspeed is actually more energy conservative that 
simply slowing the vessel down at its destination. Obviously, the shallower the 
angle of the turn, the less energy would be needed, and the more significant 
masses it can pass to use for gravity assists would also be useful. Thus, 
interstellar cyclers would probably work best when used on routes 
heavily-populated with star systems and large interstellar objects such as brown 
dwarves.</P>
<P>As a cycler passes a system, that system's inhabitants use magnetic sail 
craft to accelerate cargo to meet with the cycler, then use the same system to 
decelerate cargo left off by the cycler. The particle beams used to accelerate 
the cargo may also be used to help accelerate and/or turn the cycler as it 
passes through. The cycler ship is slowly built up as it passes from system to 
system and cycle to cycle, drawing upon resources sent to it by colonies along 
its route.</P>
<P>It is very probable that multiple interstellar cycler craft will be used 
along any one route, staggered anywhere from a few years to a few months apart. 
In this way, an interstellar trading economy can remain viable even at otherwise 
prohibitive STL speeds, as new goods from the stars would be arriving at regular 
intervals. Schroeder proposed that the original cycler on a route can 
"reproduce" after it accumulates enough resource donations. The crew of the 
cycler slowly builds up another cycler vehicle en route, and when complete the 
new vessel slows down and drops behind its "parent" ship before it accelerates 
again a few months or a few years later. The process is repeated as many times 
as necessary to create a fleet of cyclers for any one route.</P>

<P>These are just some of the possible strategies that have been proposed thus 
far in getting humans to the stars. In the century to come, as space technology 
advances, we will no doubt see an explosion of conjectures dealing with the 
possibilities of interstellar travel. Some of us may even be lucky to live long 
enough to see some of these theories become reality, and witness the beginning 
of the human race's interstellar age.</P>
