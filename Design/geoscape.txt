makes me want to have in future version a geo-scape type map where we can view infrastructure of the world

but also as a way to plan our landing sites and heists and rendezous etc. 

it's mount & blade ish with even some fallout 2 potential


for procedural generation i like the idea of quadtree where we can limit the depth rendering down the tree, but where we can nest our data layers and page in from disk only what is needed.
