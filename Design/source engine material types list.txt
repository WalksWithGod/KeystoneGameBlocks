Material surface properties
From Valve Developer Community
Jump to: navigation, search

<Half-Life 2> This is the list of material types that VMTs can recognize. The material type's name should be placed in quotation marks after $surfaceprop. Each material setting has its own unique properties, which affect the gibs they produce (if breakable) and the sound of impacts or footsteps.

Models also use $surfaceprop to define what they will sound like and decal like.

The surface properties are defined in scripts/surfaceproperties.txt and scripts/surfaceproperties_hl2.txt and are referenced by scripts/surfaceproperties_manifest.txt.

All materials and models that do not define their surfaceprop go to default.
