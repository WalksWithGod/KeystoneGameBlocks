- after watching affliction with nick nolte, made me think about adding some random-ish behaviors in the game where crew suffer from "real life" issues and it's just part of the game.  we dont have perfect characters...  we can explore a crew having to deal with other crew who for whatever reasons wind up with problems...

depression
alcoholism
intimacy issues and violence because of abusive fathers, etc
