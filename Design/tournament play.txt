There was a concept of long term tournaments they called "pantheons" which I kind of like.  It brings the long term gameplay of a turn based 4x in somewhat with short term real time tactical battles.  Having this in a tournment structure where we have seperate maps that players play and then advance and play against other players progressively via a bracket sounds pretty damn awesome.  

This is a must have feature for encouraging registrations in lieu of a MMO game.  Here we can have our tactical battles but no MMO but yet still have a mix of players involved.  

Now we've always planned on tournaments but the key difference here is that having tournmanets where each match up in the tournanment itself can last for days or weeks is key... I'd never thought of that before and this is definetly something i think we should have because it minimizes the need/desire to want a MMO because in such a tournament you can play a lot over a course of days or weeks and then advance.

A key factor of course to prevent players from dropping out is to also have a sort of NASCAR point system where players who stay in games til the end, win more points than those who drop out.  for instance, top 3 finishers may get 20, 13, 10 points and everyone else gets 7 points for finishing and 0 - 6 if they drop out depending on the conditions.
