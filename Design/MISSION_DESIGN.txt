OUR MISSIONS SHOULD STAY IN LINE WITH OUR CANON PHILOSOPHY
	- Canon promotes the highest human development.
	- To mitigate it's own indoctrination of the population, indoctrination itself is taught at an early age in school and revisisted throughout a students education.
	- Canon missions should focus on giving the user the freedom to decide how to carry out missions.  How to solve problems.  
	- Canon should stay away from metaphysical and divine intervention, magic and superstition/paranormal explanations for why a player succeeds. Or why Canon is the best system for human freedom.  
	- Canon is pro democracy but also recognizes that individuals may choose to leave the society and live on in the wilderness where there is no recogized law.  Where freedom truely reins. 
		- NOTE: In our story, "came in from the wilderness" we should offer footnotes on what coming in from the wilderness means. That it is a metaphor for leaving anarchy and coming into a social system.   That the implication is a stable social order is more advanced and thus superior to the primitive "pure freedom" of lawlessness where ultimatley only violence and physical strength and combat skill determine ownership.
