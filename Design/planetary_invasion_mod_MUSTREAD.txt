Panzer Command : Ostfront Bootcamp Campaign

that game is a very good mix between Total War tactical battles and Close Combat series...  

i really dig it, but i see it more as the part of the planet invasion expansion for my game.

- What their implementation really shines at is, it allows for realistic sized distances between ground combat units.  That's something that total war started off great at, but then failed at with Empire and Napolean.

The fact that this implementation has much larger zoom out view of units, but still visible and commandable, but with a lot of their own AI... allows for battles like Hoth with walking bots and such.... but not in a stupid clickfest RTS, but more of a general's view and less real time ability to issue orders.  There's lag and for the most part, the initial plan needs to be correct to have a chance at winning as it's hard to recover from a major error because units dont change orders instantly.
