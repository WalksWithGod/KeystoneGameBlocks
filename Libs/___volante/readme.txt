Origin.
-------

Volante is a continuation of Perst database. Perst was licensed under liberal BSD license
until version 2.49. In version 2.50 the license was changed to dual GPL/commercial license.

Volante is a fork of the latest BSD-licensed version (2.49) and is now developed
independently of Perst, preserving liberal license, so that you can use it
in both open-source and commercial code for free.
